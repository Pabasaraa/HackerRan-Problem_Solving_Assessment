# Problem Solving Skills Assessment
This repository contains my solutions to the problem-solving skills assessment tests on HackerRank. Each solution is written in JavaScript.

## Problem 1: Longest Subarray
Given an array of integers, the task is to find the length of the longest subarray containing no more than two distinct values such that the distinct values differ by no more than 1.

## Problem 2: Anagram Detector
An anagram of a string is another string with the same characters in the same frequency, in any order. For example 'abc', 'bca', 'acb', 'bac', 'cba', 'cab' are all anagrams of the string 'abc'. Given two arrays of strings, for every string in one list, determine how many anagrams of it are in the other list. Write a function that receives dictionary and query, two string arrays. It should return an array of integers where each element contains the number of anagrams of query[i] that exist in dictionary.

### Running the code
To run the code, you can use a JavaScript environment like Programiz and run the code in the environment.

` Happy Coding :) `
